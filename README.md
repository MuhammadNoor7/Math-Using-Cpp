# These C++ projects integrate programming with mathematical concepts to solve various computational problems. From ASCII conversions and prime number checks to solving the Josephus problem and generating Pascal's Triangle, each program showcases the power of C++ in practical applications.

1) ARMSTRONG FINDING : This C++ program checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
   

2) ASCII CONVERSION : This program converts characters to their corresponding ASCII values and vice versa. It is useful for understanding character encoding and working with text data at a low level.
   

3) PRIME CHECKER : This code checks whether a given number is prime and implements mathematical concepts like divisibility and square root optimization to improve performance.

4) JOSEPHUS CIRCLE : This program solves the Josephus problem, a theoretical problem related to a certain elimination game. It finds the position that remains safe.

5) MACLAURIN SERIES : It iteratively calculates and sums each term, alternating the sign for each successive term.

6) PASCAL TRIANGLE : This code generates Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients.
